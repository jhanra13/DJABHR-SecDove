title Sequence – Message Payload Fuzzer (Format/UTF‑8 Robustness)

actor Pentester as PT
participant "PentesterUI" as UI
participant "PayloadFuzzerModule" as FZ
participant "HttpClient" as HTTP
participant "Reporter" as R
participant "Target API" as API

PT -> UI: Configure patterns (non-hex, odd-length, oversized)
UI -> FZ: configure(patterns)
PT -> UI: Run
UI -> FZ: run()
loop For each pattern
  FZ -> HTTP: POST /api/messages {encrypted_msg_content: <pattern>}
  HTTP -> API: HTTPS request
  API --> HTTP: 201 Created (opaque store) or 4xx
  HTTP -> FZ: response
  FZ -> R: log({patternType, status})
end
UI -> R: summarize()
R --> UI: rates of failures/successes

note right
 Intent is to observe server/client robustness to malformed
 ciphertext formats. No plaintext is involved.
