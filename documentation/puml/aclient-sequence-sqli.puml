title Sequence â€“ SQL Injection Prober (Negative Testing)

actor Pentester as PT
participant "PentesterUI" as UI
participant "SqlProbeModule" as SM
participant "HttpClient" as HTTP
participant "Reporter" as R
participant "Target API" as API

PT -> UI: Select SQL Probe cases
UI -> SM: configure(probes)
PT -> UI: Run
UI -> SM: run()
loop For each probe
  SM -> HTTP: get/post with probe inputs
  HTTP -> API: HTTPS request (bound params expected)
  API --> HTTP: 2xx/4xx/5xx w/ error messages
  HTTP -> SM: response
  SM -> R: log({probe, status, bodySnippet})
end
UI -> R: summarize()
R --> UI: report (no injection effects expected)

note right
 Probes are designed to verify safe parameterization.
 They should not alter server state beyond standard validation.
end note
